In Java, a thread is a separate path of execution within a program. 
It allows concurrent and parallel execution of different parts of a program.
Threads can be created either by extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface.
The Thread class provides methods to control the execution of a thread, such as starting, pausing, resuming, 
and stopping the thread.
Synchronization mechanisms, such as locks and semaphores, are used to coordinate the access to shared resources among threads.
