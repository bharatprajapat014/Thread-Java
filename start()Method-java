In Java, the start() method is a method of the Thread class, which is used to start a new thread of execution.
When you call the start() method on a Thread object, it creates a new thread and executes the code in the run() method of that
thread in parallel with the main thread.
It's important to note that you should not call the run() method directly to start a new thread. If you do, the code will execute in the same thread as the calling code and will not be concurrent.
Instead,
you should always call the start() method to start a new thread.
Here's an example of how to use the start() method:

public class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("New thread running");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start(); // Start the new thread
        System.out.println("Main thread running");
    }
}
In this example, we define a class MyThread that extends the Thread class and overrides its run() method. 
In the Main class, we create a new instance of MyThread and start it by calling its start() method. 
This will execute the run() method in a new thread, allowing the main thread to continue executing the rest of the code.
